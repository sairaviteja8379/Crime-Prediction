Crime Prediction Using Python

This project aims to predict crime occurrences in different locations using machine learning techniques in Python. By analyzing historical crime data and socio-economic factors, this model attempts to forecast crime hotspots, allowing law enforcement agencies to allocate resources more effectively.

Project Structure

Data Processing: Preprocessing and feature engineering on historical crime data to clean and prepare it for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization and analysis of crime trends to understand key factors affecting crime rates.

Modeling: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms to predict crime occurrences.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Deployment: (Optional) Flask API for serving predictions in real time.

Features

Data Cleaning: Removal of missing values, handling outliers, and normalization.

Feature Engineering: Creation of new features based on spatial and temporal aspects.

Model Selection: Testing models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.

Visualization: Crime trends analysis and hotspot mapping using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Prediction: Predicting the likelihood of crime in specific locations based on selected features.

Usage:

Data Preprocessing: Use the preprocessing notebook to clean and prepare your dataset.

Train the Model: Select a model in the modeling notebook, train it, and evaluate its performance.

Prediction: Use the final trained model to make predictions on new data.

Results

The modelâ€™s performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) are recorded and visualized in the Evaluation section. Crime hotspots and time-based trends are visualized using heatmaps and line charts.
